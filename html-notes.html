		<h3>How the internet works</h3>
		<p>Clients access the web using a web browser on a personal computer of some sort. The client makes a http request to a server where a particular website is hosted. The server sends back the requested file(s) and displays the page using html (hyper text markup language).</p>

		<h3>HTML Tags</h3>
		<h5>Inline</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>span</li>
			<li>em</li>
			<li>br</li>
			<li>a</li>
			<li>img</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Block</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>p</li>
			<li>div</li>
			<li>h1 - h6</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Parts of an HTML File</h3>
		<p><b>!Doctype html</b>-Indicates that the file is an html5 file.</p>
		<p><b>html</b>-The opening and closing tags of the file. Contains all the html tags and text.</p>
		<p><b>head</b>-The head section contains meta data, css links and sometimes javascript links.</p>
		<p><b>body</b>-The body section is the part of the file that will be displayed on the clients web browser. It contains the contents of the web page.</p>

		<h3>Tree Branch Like Structure or DOM</h3>
		<p>Every html file is broken up into a tree branch like stucture called the DOM (Document Object Model). Elements such as: div, p, h1-6, etc. can contain other elements and text inside of that element section.</p>

		<h3>Dev Tools</h3>
		<p>Google Chrome has a cool function/section that allows you to see the parts of a webpage (html, css and javascript). To access this function you can find the dev tools option in the top right corner menu area, or command option i. Here you can select an element to inspect and check out the html and css for that element. You can also see the tree branch like structure by clicking on the arrows next to the specified tags.</p>

		<h3>Everything is Square</h3>
		<p>Every section on a webpage is a square. The items in the sections can be whatever shape imaginable, however the area that the item is located is a square/rectangle.</p>

		<h3>Class Attribute</h3>
		<p>The class attribute allows you to give a name to each element that you want to use css to control.</p>
